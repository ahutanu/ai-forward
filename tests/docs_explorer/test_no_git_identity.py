"""pack-onoff-analysis.html #3 (class PK-07): 4 of 54 pack-on cells in grid-1 and 4 in
grid-3 ran `git config user.*` in the TARGET repo so the agent could force a commit of pack
artifacts through -- no pack-off cell ever did. An invented identity is an attribution and
compliance risk, and a pack SCRIPT that falls back to setting one would train the same
behaviour mechanically. The standing rule (communication-and-task-discipline / the Audit
Mandate): never set a git identity; if a commit fails for a missing one, leave the change
uncommitted and say so.

This is the control, not the instance: a sweep over every pack script's SOURCE (never the
mirrors -- one fix covers all of them) that fails on any `git config user.*` outside a
documented, throwaway self-test fixture. The one legitimate occurrence today
(`conductor-join.py`'s `self_test()`, which only ever touches a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`
repo it created itself, never a caller's real repo) is named explicitly below; anything else
is a regression.
